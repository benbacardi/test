        <p>If you have been notified by email that you have priority access to the site, please <a href="https://accounts.ocado.com/auth-service/sso/login" target="_parent">log in</a> to view the slots available to you.</p>
        <p>We are releasing these gradually, but demand continues to be high so they will sell out quickly. Unfortunately, we can't guarantee there will be slots available for everyone. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, there are currently no new delivery slots available for general release.</p>
        <p>If you have a delivery booked for any other date, please wait here in the queue to go through and edit. </p>
        <p><i><strong>Once you are on the site, we politely request that you make all changes and complete your order in one session.</strong></i></p>
